A sample repository inspired by the tweet above and named after the mathematician that allegedly formalized the equation 
of a line.

Exposes a method that accepts the slope and y-intercept of a line and returns a `Line` instance that will help you 
calculate `x` or `y` given the other.

## Warning
You probably don't want to actually use this library.  This is part of a security project for the Georgia Institute of 
Technology's Cybersecurity practicum.  The `preinstall` script on this library has been modified from the original 
version that's been uploaded to an internal repository. The artifact in NPM works as advertised, but is used to 
demonstrate dependency confusion attacks.
